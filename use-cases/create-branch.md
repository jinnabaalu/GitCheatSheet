# Create Branch

## Checkout to the upstream branch

```bash
git checkout develop
```

## Pull Latest

```bash
git pull
```

## Create a new branch

```bash
git checkout -b jinnabalu/branchName
```

`jinnabalu`: the user name of the GitHub, to recognize the user by branch name easily when working with the team

`branchName`: branchName for readability we maintain [NamingConvension](https://github.com/JinnaBalu/GitCheatSheet/blob/master/NamingConvension.md#naming-convention-for-programming) for naming the branch.
