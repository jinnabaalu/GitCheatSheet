#### Step 3 - Reset

**Step 3.1** - Copy the commit-hash that you want to reset

All the commits that top of the selected commit-hash (not including the entered commit-hash), will be deleted.

**Step 3.2** - Hard reset to go back to the early stage

```bash
git reset <commit-hash> --hard
```

#### Step 3 - Force push to the repository

```bash
git push <remote> master --force
```

`<remote>` can be `origin` is the default.

> NOTE: Be careful when removing the previous commits, there is no going back once you did these changes.
